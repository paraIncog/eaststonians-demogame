			Thank you for playing the demo of the placeholder name game (yes, a placeholder). I wanted to do something just after summer.
			Didn't want to do anything strategic map game, or mod a game to simulate that era of Estonian history (because there are already too many of these games).
			So I made this a more choice-based, persons-centered, and less authoritative.
			Maybe when I have more time and motivation ;) to enlarge the game, and implement more features to this game, or make more games.
